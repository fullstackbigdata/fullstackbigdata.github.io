      "content"  : "Trio comes with support for 9 different color themes as well as Font Awesome icons as logos.\n\nColor Themes\nBy default, Trio has two basic colors – black and baby blue. Black is used for all text and headings and this color is fixed. The other color (which is baby blue, by default) may be changed. Trio ships with 8 other colors (copied from Lanyon theme). These colors are listed in _sass/_colors.scss. If you want to change the color theme, simply change the $theme-color variable in _sass/_colors.scss:\n\n$theme-color: $base-08; /* Red */\n\n\n\nThanks to Mark Otto and Chris Kempson’s base16 for these themes. See the README.md on GitHub Trio page for a screenshot of the red theme.\n\nLogos\nTrio also comes with support for logos, as you can see on the Trio homepage and this post. The logos are simply Font Awesome icons dipped in the current color theme. Post logos are shown both in the paginated index on the Trio homepage as well in the title of the blog post. In order to add a post logo, simply search for an icon on Font Awesome and find the icon keyword. Simply add icon keyword as the logo field in the YAML from-matter to the post’s .md file.\n\n---\nlayout: post\ntitle: Blog Post Title\nlogo: leaf\n---\n\n\n\nThe above example will add a leaf logo for the blog post.\n\nFont Awesome has a few animated icons that can also be used. Animated icons could be useful to draw attention to a new post (such as this post).\n\nIn addition to individual post logos, Trio also supports a site logo that appears in the footer of all pages. Site wide logo is also a Font Awesome icon and may be set in a similar manner. The only difference is that instead of setting the logo in a .md file, you need to set the logo in _config.yml file:\n\nfort_awesome_icon: 'cog fa-spin'\n\n\n",
