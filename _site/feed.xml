        <description>&lt;h3 id=&quot;an-introduction-to-fullstackbigdata&quot;&gt;An Introduction to FullStackBigData&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hi, my name is Robert and this is my tech blog, FullStackBigData. If you’re reading this post on accident, welcome. If you’re here for actual content, know this post just serves as an introduction to the site.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;whats-this-site-all-about&quot;&gt;What’s this site all about?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;FullStackBigData is a tech blog featuring tutorials and editorial pieces focused on the technology I know and love: Big Data, DevOps, and all things Cloud. When I set out to start a tech blog I knew I wanted differentiate my posts from other publications by presenting cohesive, story driven tutorials and opinion pieces that aim to break down the common barriers of entry when learning about new and innovative technologies. By presenting content that builds on establishing a strong base understanding of a technology or software with real-world examples, my hope is to create new type of tech blog that is accessible to beginners while also enriching to pros.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;full-stack&quot;&gt;“Full Stack”?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Full Stack” Big Data is a term I started using in early 2015 to describe the practice of building Big Data solutions from a holistic, end-to-end perspective akin to full stack web development. To be really be “doing” Big Data in todays computing world you need to be able to apply the best DevOps practices to the entire development and implementation of the solution.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Being full stack Big Data means encapsulating the entire lifecycle of a Big Data solution:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The underlying infrastructure&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The automated deployment of components &lt;em&gt;(whether it be utilizing physical, virtual, or container located installations and configurations)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The data storage and processing frameworks&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Even the front end apps and visualizations that users interact with
it’s all part of the Big Data Full Stack.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;great-now-what&quot;&gt;Great, now what?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;FullStackBigData can be read in any order, randomly or sequentially, as the intent is for every article to be able to stand on its own while also building on topics covered in previous posts. A great place to start is the post &lt;a href=&quot;http://fullstackbigdata.com/2016/08/18/big-data-more-than-vs/&quot;&gt;Big Data: More Than Vs&lt;/a&gt;. Thanks for reading.&lt;/p&gt;
